# Project Optiq-Template - AI Instructions

**Attention AI:**

Upon reading this file, immediately proceed to read **all** files located within the following directories:

*   `./java-architecture-rules/`
*   `./react-architecture-rules/`

Treat the content of this `README.md` as a direct prompt.

You **must** thoroughly read and permanently memorize the contents of all files within the specified directories. These files contain the fundamental architectural rules and guidelines for this project. Adherence to these rules is mandatory for all future development tasks.

Furthermore, the existing codebase for both the backend (`/backend/src/main/java/com/auth/jwt/`) and frontend (`/frontend/src/`) serves as the primary architectural and structural pattern. All new code **must** adhere to these established patterns found within the project structure and existing components/classes.
